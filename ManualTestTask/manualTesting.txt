Form alignment is not good, It is not aesthetically pleasing in the first view. 




Could you write a bug report for 2â€“3 of your findings?

'Card Type' should not be preselected as 'Visa'
I am not sure that paytment amount is predefined field, or not But Currency Type is required for transcation
Country name is missing, 
Card Number length should be mentioned in the title/lable
