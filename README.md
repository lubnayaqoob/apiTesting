Implementation of Package	Challenge. I have used KnapSack Alogrithm to find the optimal Indexes.

## Installation

Use a node js environment to run this project.
```
Node version v14.17.0
npm install
npm run start
```

```
launch.json
```
is configured so, user can execute in "Run and debug" mode as well.
The ```package.json``` contains the main script to run the whole program: In Package.json change the name of file if you want to do the testing with a different File. 
```
"scripts": {
  "test": "NODE_ENV=test mocha './{,!(node_modules)/**/}*.spec.*' --exit", 
}
```

## OutPut
The system will generate output on the terminal for passed and failed test cases.
